# Analysis-and-testing-of-different-Recommendation-Systems-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In todayâ€™s world there is an abundance of data available to us through the advancement in technology and the progression of the internet. With all this data available to us, it is therefore important that we filter through this data and allow individuals to focus on data which is more relevant to them.

Using a variety of evaluation metrics, we will be able to compare these systems and conclude which seems to be the most effective.
